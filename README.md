# This Project is a storage solution for *.vssx files converted from *.vss
These files have been converted from .vss files found from around the web over the years. It uses a python script to open Visio 2013
in the background and covert all .vss files from a directory.

This is a self created project and there is no support on these files. I'm sharing to the community as possible. They have not had any quality control checked on the files.
